## python-snake :snake:

A recreation of the classic game "Snake" in Python with the "pygame" library.

### Here are the steps to running the game:

Step 1 - Ensure that python 3 is installed on your computer.  
You can do this by running this command in your terminal (Command Prompt/Powershell for Windows and Bash for Mac/Linux):
```
   $ python3 --version
     
     Python 3.*.*
```
If it outputs a number similar to the one above, your version of python should be able to run the game.  
  
Step 2 - Install ```pygame``` on your computer.
